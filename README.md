# Guzzle Layer (Archived)

> ⚠️ **DEPRECATED**: This package has been renamed to [easy-http/guzzle-adapter](https://github.com/easy-http/guzzle-adapter). Please use the new package instead.

This is an HTTP layer for Guzzle Client based on [HTTP layer contracts](https://github.com/easy-http/layer-contracts).
These contracts standardize the way you consume HTTP clients like Guzzle, Symfony, and others with a consistent interface. No matter what client you are using,
the methods you have to execute to do the job are the same for all!!.

:books: Check out the [Documentation](https://easy-http.com/docs) to learn how to use any layer that implements these contracts.

This library supports the following versions of Guzzle Http Client.
